The king, driven by fear of rebellion, moved his capital to this remote location and built a fortress on the summit of the rock. Today, visitors can see the remains of the palace, which include royal baths, intricately designed gardens, and an impressive system of water management that was centuries ahead of its time.\n"),

As you approach the temple, you pass through the sacred moat and the grand entrance, adorned with traditional Kandyan art and sculpture. Inside, the relic chamber is intricately decorated with gold and precious stones, and though the tooth itself is rarely displayed to the public, it is housed in a golden casket during important ceremonies."

                    "Constructed during the British colonial period in 1921, the Nine Arches Bridge stands as a testament to the engineering marvels of its time. What makes this bridge truly remarkable is that it is built entirely of solid stone and bricks, without the use of steel, a construction technique that was rare for its era. Stretching across a 91-meter length and standing 24 meters high, the bridge's elegant arches gracefully curve over a deep valley, creating a stunning visual spectacle that blends seamlessly with the surrounding natural beauty."
